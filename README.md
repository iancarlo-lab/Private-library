# Private Library

## This is an API exercise to simulate a private library app.

### Techs used in this project:

- HTML
- CSS/SASS/SCSS
- Javascript/JSX
- React.js
- Bootstrap
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Helmet.js
- Chai/Mocha

### Basic user stories: 

- Nothing from my website will be cached in my client.

- The headers will say that the site is powered by 'PHP 4.2.0' even though it isn't (as a security measure).

- I can *post* a title to `/api/books` to add a book and returned will be the object with the title and a unique _id.

- I can *get* `/api/books` to retrieve an array of all books containing title, _id, and commentcount.

- I can *get* `/api/books/{id}` to retrieve a single object of a book containing **_title, _id, & an array of comments** (empty array if no comments present).

- I can *post* a comment to `/api/books/{id}` to add a comment to a book and returned will be the books object similar to get `/api/books/{id}` including the new comment.

- I can *delete* `/api/books/{_id}` to delete a book from the collection. Returned will be *'delete successful'* if successful.

- If I try to *request* a book that doesn't exist I will be returned *'no book exists'.*

- I can send a *delete* request to `/api/books` to delete all books in the database. Returned will be *'complete delete successful'* if successful.

- All 6 functional tests required are complete and passing.
